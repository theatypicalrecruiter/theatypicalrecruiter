- 👋 Hi, I’m @theatypicalrecruiter
- 👀 I’m interested in helping those looking for development work via contract, contract to hire, or permanent (direct hire) positions find them.
- 🌱 I’m (seriously wanting to) learn more about what those I work for (the developers) do. I don't want to be "one of those people" who don't understand what the people their talking to do.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on finding good people, good jobs, that fulfill them and make them happy.
- 📫 How to reach me email me! jen@ptech-info.com, Twitter: @theatypicalJen
